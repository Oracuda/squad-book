# Advance and Secure (AAS)

Advance and Secure is identical to **Random Advance and Secure**, apart from the fact that all objectives are the same every match, and are revealed from the start. This makes
the gamemode a lot more prone to **Rushing Backcaps**, where one team rushes the early caps of the other as they are already revealed.
