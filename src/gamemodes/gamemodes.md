# Gamemodes

Squad has several gamemodes that each operate differently. Although, all gamemodes are defineable by a shared mechanic: Tickets.
Tickets are the backbone of every team's success in a Squad match.

Each team starts with a preset amount of Tickets, usually in the hundereds. On the **Random Advance and Secure** Gamemode, as well as **Advance and Secure**,
both teams start with the same amount of Tickets, but this can differ in other gamemodes.

Tickets are used up when any of the following happens:

- A player gives up while incapacitated, depleting one ticket[^1]
- A player is incapacitated and bleeds out, depleting one ticket[^1]
- A player takes enough damage immediately after being revived from incapacitation, which would otherwise send them to the incapacitated state, depleting one ticket[^1]
- A player takes enough damage that they skip the incapacitated state and is immediately killed, depleting one ticket[^1]
- Any of the aforementioned happening to a team Commander depletes two Tickets instead of one.
- A vehicle is destroyed, depleting one or multiple tickets depending on the vehicle.
- A radio is dug down by the enemy and bleeds out.[^2]
- On **Random Advance and Secure** or **Advance and Secure**, when a teams first Objective is captured by the enemy team, the defending team is put on a **Mercy Bleed** where the defending team loses 60 tickets per minute (1 ticket per second) for as long as that objective is held by the enemy for.
- On **Advance and Secure**, capturing more points over the enemy will put their team onto a **Ticket Bleed**.
- On **Invasion**, when the Attacking Team captures the Defender's Final Objective, the Defenders ticket count is immediately depleted to zero.
- On **Territory Control**, when the enemy team holds more **Territories** (or Hexes), they put the other team on a **Ticket Bleed**.

[^1]: Player deaths caused by team kills do not deplete tickets.
[^2]: Radios can be saved by the team who placed them by either digging them down or up. Friendly Radios can be dug down and scuttled while bleeding out without depleting your tickets, and do not need to be dug up and out of the bleeding state first.

On **Advance and Secure** and **Random Advance and Secure**, When a team reaches 0 tickets, the opposing team wins the match. Matches can be a stalemate if both teams have the same amount of tickets and the Match Timer depletes.
If the Match Timer depletes and both teams do not have the same ticket count, the team with more tickets wins.

On **Invasion**, the Defending team wins if the match timer depletes before the Attackers capture all objectives. The Defenders can also lose by their tickets being depleted from other sources of ticket depletion.

Maps often have multiple **Layers** for each gamemode, which changes the layout of capture points and some other factors.
